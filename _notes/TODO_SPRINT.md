# TODO:

- PLAN UI SYSTEM.
- get buttons working


- get map working

- get n9p working



- PLAN UPGRADES / FEATURES! Be specific!!  
Once we have features planned, we can plan architecture better.   
Try to have an *EXTREMELY DIVERSE* set of upgrades.  

From there, we can make better architectural decisions, based on what we ACTUALLY NEED, not what we think we need.



# DONE:
(Any task below this point is done)
